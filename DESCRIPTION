Description: Functions for performing stochastic search variable selection (SSVS) 
    for binary and continuous outcomes and visualizing the results. 
    SSVS is a Bayesian variable selection method used to estimate the probability 
    that individual predictors should be included in a regression model. 
    Using MCMC estimation, the method samples thousands of regression models 
    in order to characterize the model uncertainty regarding both the predictor 
    set and the regression parameters.
